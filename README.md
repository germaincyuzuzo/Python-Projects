The main focus of the following repository is for study purposes. It contains different beginner python projects that requires Python fundamentals to solve.

# 21Number Game (Explained)

21, Bagram, or Twenty plus one is a game which progresses by counting up 1 to 21, with the player who calls “21” is eliminated. 
It can be played between any number of players. Implementation This is a simple 21 number game using Python programming language. 
The game illustrated here is between the player and the computer. There can be many variations in the game.

The player can choose to start first or second.
The list of numbers is shown before the Player takes his turn so that it becomes convenient.
If consecutive numbers are not given in input then the player is automatically disqualified.
The player loses if he gets the chance to call 21 and wins otherwise.

# Word Guessing Game

This program is a simple word-guessing game where the user has to guess the characters in a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts. 
The program provides feedback after each guess, helping the user to either complete the word or lose the game based on their guesses.

# Rock Paper Scissors

In this game, the user gets the first chance to pick the option between Rock, paper, and scissors. After the computer select from the remaining two choices(randomly), the winner is decided as per the rules.

Winning Rules as follows:
Rock vs paper-> paper wins
Rock vs scissor-> Rock wins
paper vs scissor-> scissor wins.

# Number Guesing Game

Explanation: 
If the User inputs range, let’s say from 1 to 100. And compiler randomly selected 42 as the integer. And now the guessing game started, so the user entered 50 as his/her first guess. The compiler shows “Try Again! You guessed too high”. That’s mean the random number (i.e., 42) doesn’t fall in the range from 50 to 100. That’s the importance of guessing half of the range. And again, the user guesses half of 50 (Could you tell me why?). So the half of 50 is 25. The user enters 25 as his/her second guess. This time compiler will show, “Try Again! You guessed too small”. That’s mean the integers less than 25 (from 1 to 25) are useless to be guessed. Now the range for user guessing is shorter, i.e., from 25 to 50. Intelligently! The user guessed half of this range, so that, user guessed 37 as his/her third guess.  This time again the compiler shows the output, “Try Again! You guessed too small”. For the user, the guessing range is getting smaller by each guess. Now, the guessing range for user is from 37 to 50, for which the user guessed 43 as his/her fourth guess. This time the compiler will show an output “Try Again! You guessed too high”. So, the new guessing range for users will be from 37 to 43, again for which the user guessed the half of this range, that is, 40 as his/her fifth guess.  This time the compiler shows the output, “Try Again! You guessed too small”. Leaving the guess even smaller such that from 41 to 43. And now the user guessed 41 as his/her sixth guess. Which is wrong and shows output “Try Again! You guessed too small”. And finally, the User Guessed the right number which is 42 as his/her seventh guess.
